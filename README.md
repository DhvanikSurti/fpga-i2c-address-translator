# fpga-i2c-address-translator
FPGA-based I²C address translator in Verilog. Acts as an I²C slave to the bus master and master to the target device, dynamically remapping addresses to avoid conflicts. Supports bidirectional read/write, standard I²C timing, FSM-based design, simulation, and testbenches.
